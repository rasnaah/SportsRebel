                                  improved communication with consumers. Using several types of information technology communication methods enable companies to saturate the economic
                                   market with their message. Companies may also receive more consumer feedback through these electronic communication methods.

                                   and update internal documents and contracts and relay relevant data to other departments instantly. These methods also help companies reach
                                    consumers through mobile devices in a real-time format.
